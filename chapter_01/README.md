## Explanation of the Output:

   ### Initial Message:

Hello, world

    This message is printed from the println! statement in the main function, confirming that the program has started executing.

## MRF Construction:

Constructed MRF with 27 nodes.

    The program constructs a Markov Random Field (MRF) based on the sequences read from the FASTA file. The MRF is created by defining nodes for each position in each sequence, and edges are added between adjacent positions in each sequence.
    In this case, the MRF consists of 27 nodes. Each node corresponds to a sequence position (seq_id, position_in_sequence).

Matrix Dimensions (nalgebra & ndarray):

nalgebra matrix dimensions: 10 x 10
ndarray matrix dimensions: 10 x 10

    These two lines display the dimensions of the matrices created using the nalgebra and ndarray crates.
        Both matrices are 10x10, filled with ones.
        The nalgebra matrix is created with DMatrix::<f32>::from_element(10, 10, 1.0), while the ndarray matrix is created with Array2::<f32>::ones((10, 10)). Both matrices are used to demonstrate matrix operations for possible future high-performance computing (HPC) tasks.

MRF Edges for Nodes (Up to 5 Nodes):

    Node (0, 3) has edges:
      -> (0, 4) with potential = 1
    Node (2, 8) has edges:
      -> (2, 9) with potential = 1
    Node (1, 5) has edges:
      -> (1, 6) with potential = 1
    Node (1, 2) has edges:
      -> (1, 3) with potential = 1
    Node (1, 6) has edges:
      -> (1, 7) with potential = 1

        This section displays the details of the first 5 nodes in the MRF, showing the edges (neighbors) that connect them.
        Each node is represented as a tuple (seq_id, position_in_sequence).
        For each node, it lists the neighboring node and the edge's "potential" value.
        For example:
            Node (0, 3) connects to (0, 4) with a potential of 1.
            Node (2, 8) connects to (2, 9) with a potential of 1.
        These edges represent the relationship between consecutive positions in the same sequence, with each edge having a constant potential of 1.0.

Conclusion:

    Markov Random Field Construction:
        The program successfully constructs a Markov Random Field (MRF) from the sequences in the FASTA file, where each node represents a position in a sequence, and edges represent adjacencies between consecutive positions.
        The output indicates that 27 nodes were created, which corresponds to the total number of sequence positions in the input sequences, with each node connected to its next position (the node's neighbor) via edges that have a potential of 1.0.

    Matrix Operations:
        The program demonstrates the use of matrices (from the nalgebra and ndarray libraries) in the context of this MRF model. Both matrices are initialized with constant values (1.0), and their dimensions (10x10) are printed. These matrices could be extended for more complex computations or matrix-based operations in future steps.

    Edge Details:
        The program also outputs the edges for the first five nodes in the MRF. The adjacency between nodes is straightforward: each node is connected to its next sequential position in the same sequence, with a constant potential (this is likely a simplification, and in a real-world scenario, the potential would vary depending on the actual nucleotide sequence data).

In summary, the program demonstrates the creation of a simple pairwise Markov Random Field from sequence data, along with basic matrix manipulation, and successfully outputs the key structural elements (nodes and edges) for verification.
