Explanation of the Code:

This Rust program demonstrates the construction of a suffix array for a genomic sequence. The suffix array is an array of integers that represent the starting indices of the suffixes of a string (or genome sequence) sorted in lexicographical order.

The program uses Rayon for parallel processing to speed up the construction of the suffix array by dividing the task into multiple chunks, processing those chunks in parallel, and then merging the results. Key Components:
load_genome Function:

    This function loads a large genomic sequence from a FASTA file into a String.
    It reads the file line by line and skips lines that start with >, which are header lines in FASTA format. The sequence lines (non-header lines) are concatenated together to form the full genome sequence.

### build_suffix_array Function:
    This function constructs a naive suffix array for a given string (seq).
    It generates all suffixes of the string by indexing them from each position in the string and sorting them lexicographically. The suffixes are represented by their starting indices in the sorted order.
    The sorting is done using Rust's sort_by method, which compares slices (seq[a..] and seq[b..]).

### build_parallel_suffix_array Function:
    This function parallelizes the process of building the suffix array by dividing the genome sequence into num_chunks parts.
    It calculates the chunk size and splits the genome into multiple parts, then uses Rayon's par_iter to process each chunk concurrently.
    For each chunk, it builds a local suffix array, adjusting the indices by the starting position of the chunk to map them back to the full genome.
    After processing the chunks, it merges the results and performs a final global sort to ensure lexicographical order across the chunk boundaries.

Main Function:

    The main function loads a genomic sequence from a file (example_genome.fasta), splits it into chunks, and builds the suffix array in parallel using build_parallel_suffix_array.
    It then prints statistics about the genome and the suffix array:
        Length of the genome.
        Length of the suffix array.
        The first 10 entries in the suffix array.

Input:

FASTA File Format:

>seq1
ATGCGTACGTTAGCAGT
>seq2
CGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGC
>seq3
GCTAGCTAGTGCATGCA

The program reads this sequence and combines the lines into a single string representing the genome.

Processing Flow:

Load Genome:
    The sequence from the FASTA file is read and concatenated into a single string:

    ATGCGTACGTTAGCAGTCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCGCTAGCTAGTGCATGCA

Build Parallel Suffix Array:

    The genome is split into 8 chunks (as specified in the code, but can be adjusted).
    Each chunk is processed in parallel using Rayon to build a partial suffix array.
    The final suffix array is obtained by merging the results from all chunks and performing a final sort.

Output:

    The length of the genome is displayed (52 characters).
    The length of the suffix array is the same as the genome (since every suffix is indexed).
    The first 10 entries of the suffix array are shown, which represent the starting indices of the lexicographically sorted suffixes.

Output Breakdown:

Genome length: 52 Suffix array length: 52 First 10 entries in suffix array: [51, 20, 6, 11, 32, 28, 24, 38, 14, 42]

Genome Length (52): This is the length of the concatenated genomic sequence.
Suffix Array Length (52): This is the number of suffixes in the genome, which equals the length of the genome (since each suffix is represented by its starting index).
First 10 Entries in the Suffix Array: These are the indices of the first 10 suffixes in lexicographical order:
    51: The index of the suffix starting at position 51 in the genome.
    20: The index of the suffix starting at position 20 in the genome, and so on.

Concepts Used:

Suffix Array:
    A suffix array is an array of integers that gives the starting indices of the suffixes of a string sorted in lexicographical order. It is widely used in string processing algorithms, including genome assembly and search algorithms.

Parallelism (Rayon):

    Rayon is used to parallelize the construction of suffix arrays by dividing the genome into chunks and processing them concurrently. This improves performance for large genomes.

FASTA Format Parsing:
    The program reads the genome in FASTA format, ignoring headers (lines starting with >), and constructs a single string of the genomic sequence.

Conclusion:

This program efficiently constructs a suffix array for a genomic sequence using parallel processing. It is a useful tool for large-scale genomic data analysis, and the parallel approach with Rayon ensures that the computation is fast even for large genomes. The suffix array is a fundamental data structure used in bioinformatics tasks such as sequence matching, genome indexing, and alignment.
