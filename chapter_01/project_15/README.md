## Explanation of the Code:

This program generates a CSV file (gene_expression.csv) with randomly generated data. Each row in the CSV contains n_features random feature values followed by a label (0 or 1). The code uses the rand crate to generate random floating-point numbers for features and random labels.
## Key Components:

    Imports:
        std::fs::File: To create and write to the CSV file.
        std::io::{self, Write}: Provides functionality for writing to the file.
        rand::Rng: From the rand crate, used for generating random numbers.

  ###  generate_csv_file function:
        This function generates the CSV file.
        It creates a file named gene_expression.csv using File::create.
        The function generates n_rows rows of data, each containing n_features random floating-point values (representing gene expression features), followed by a random label (0 or 1).

 ###   Main Logic:
        The outer loop (for _ in 0..n_rows) generates the rows for the CSV.
        For each row, a list of n_features random floating-point values between 0.0 and 10.0 is generated using rng.gen_range(0.0..10.0).
        A random label (0 or 1) is also generated using rng.gen_range(0..2).
        These features and the label are then combined into a single line, with values separated by commas, and written to the file.

    Error Handling:
        The io::Result<()> return type allows for proper error handling when creating or writing to the file. If an error occurs during the file operations, the function returns an error.

    main function:
        The main function simply calls generate_csv_file(), and if it succeeds, prints a success message.

### Example Output (Sample Line in CSV File):

Here is an example of a single line from the generated gene_expression.csv:

0.6784623,3.4945132,7.343655,1.6893423,2.015948,...,0

    Feature Values: The first n_features values are random floating-point numbers between 0.0 and 10.0, representing features of gene expression.
    Label: The last value is either 0 or 1, randomly assigned, which could represent a classification label.

Output Message:

CSV file generated successfully!

This message is printed once the CSV file is successfully created and populated with random data.
### Conclusion:

The program creates a large CSV file with synthetic data suitable for tasks like training a machine learning model, performing data analysis, or testing algorithms that require large datasets with numerous features. By adjusting n_rows and n_features, you can control the size of the dataset. This approach is useful for generating mock gene expression data for experimentation.
