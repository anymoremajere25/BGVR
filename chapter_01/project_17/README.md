## Explanation of the Code:

This Rust program downloads a FASTQ file from the NCBI FTP server using the reqwest crate. The FASTQ file is then saved locally to a specified output path.
Key Components:

  ###  HTTP Request (reqwest::blocking::get):
        The program uses reqwest to make an HTTP GET request to download a FASTQ file. This request is made synchronously (blocking) since reqwest::blocking is used, meaning the program will wait for the download to complete before proceeding.

    ### File Writing:
        The program creates a local file (downloaded_sample.fastq) using std::fs::File::create.
        It uses a BufWriter for efficient writing, which buffers the data before writing it to the file.

    ### Error Handling:
        Errors are handled using the Result type and boxed into a Box<dyn Error>. If the download or file writing fails, the program will return an error with a description of the issue.

  ### Streaming Data:
        The response body is streamed directly into the file using response.bytes(), which reads the entire content of the response and writes it to the file in one go.

    ### Dependencies:
        reqwest: Used for making HTTP requests. The blocking feature is enabled for synchronous requests.

### Detailed Breakdown:

    Fetching FASTQ File:
        The URL fastq_url points to the location of a sample FASTQ file. The code performs a blocking HTTP GET request to retrieve this file.
        Error Handling: If the request fails (e.g., due to network issues, server errors), the program checks whether the HTTP status code is a success (response.status().is_success()). If not, it returns an error with the HTTP status code.

   ### Saving FASTQ File Locally:
        The program creates a local file called downloaded_sample.fastq using File::create. It then creates a buffered writer (BufWriter) to handle file output efficiently.
        The response.bytes() method is called to read the response body into memory. This bytes data is then written to the local file using writer.write_all(&bytes).

   ### Completion Message:
        Once the file is successfully downloaded and written to disk, the program prints a success message: "FASTQ file has been successfully downloaded to 'downloaded_sample.fastq'".

### Dependencies (Cargo.toml):

The dependencies in the Cargo.toml file are necessary for this program to run:

[package]
name = "project_6"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.12", features = ["blocking"] }

    reqwest: The latest version of reqwest (0.12) is used to perform HTTP requests, with the "blocking" feature enabled to perform synchronous (blocking) requests.

### Program Execution Steps:

    The program starts and attempts to download the FASTQ file from the provided URL.
    It checks whether the HTTP request was successful.
    If the request is successful, it opens a local file to write the downloaded data.
    It streams the response body into the file.
    Once the file is written, it prints a success message indicating that the FASTQ file has been successfully downloaded.

Output:

Upon successful execution, the program will print:

FASTQ file has been successfully downloaded to 'downloaded_sample.fastq'.

This confirms that the FASTQ file has been successfully fetched from the URL and saved locally to the downloaded_sample.fastq file.
Potential Improvements/Considerations:

    ### Error Handling:
        More specific error handling can be added to address different failure points (e.g., invalid URL, write permissions).
        It might be useful to implement retry logic in case of transient network errors.

    Streaming (for large files):
        Currently, the program reads the entire file into memory using response.bytes(). For very large files, you might want to stream the content chunk-by-chunk and write it incrementally to avoid memory exhaustion.

### Running the Program:

To run this program:

    Add the dependencies to your Cargo.toml file.
    Save the provided code to a .rs file (e.g., main.rs).
    Run the program using Cargo:

    cargo run

The program will download the FASTQ file to the current working directory.
