## Explanation of the Code:

This Rust program reads sequences from a FASTA file, processes them in parallel to calculate the GC content (the percentage of nucleotides that are either 'G' or 'C') of each sequence, and outputs the length and GC count for each sequence.
### 1. Dependencies:

    bio::io::fasta: This is part of the bio crate, which provides tools to read biological sequence files like FASTA.
    rayon::prelude::*: This imports Rayon’s parallel iterators, which allow the program to process multiple sequences in parallel.

### 2. Function Definitions:
load_sequences function:

    Purpose: This function reads all the sequences from a FASTA file and returns them as a vector of strings.

    Explanation:
        The fasta::Reader::from_file("example.fasta") is used to open the FASTA file.
        A Vec<String> is created to store the sequences.
        The program reads each sequence record, skips the FASTA header (lines starting with '>'), and stores the sequences (actual nucleotide strings) in the vector.
        Finally, it returns the vector of sequences.

### main function:

    Purpose: The main function orchestrates the workflow:
        Calls the load_sequences() function to load the sequences from the FASTA file into memory.
        Uses Rayon’s par_iter() to process each sequence in parallel. For each sequence, it calculates:
            The length of the sequence.
            The number of 'G' and 'C' nucleotides (GC content).
        Prints the length and GC count for each sequence.
        After processing, it prints the total number of sequences that were successfully processed.

  ###  Parallel Processing:
        par_iter() is a Rayon function that converts an iterator into a parallel iterator. This allows processing multiple sequences simultaneously, which is particularly useful for large datasets.

    GC Content Calculation:
        For each sequence, seq.chars().filter(|&c| c == 'G' || c == 'C').count() counts how many characters are either 'G' or 'C' in that sequence.

3. Output:

The program prints the following:

    Length and GC count: For each sequence, it prints the length of the sequence and how many 'G' or 'C' nucleotides are present.
    Processing Summary: After processing all sequences, it prints how many sequences were processed.

### Sample Output Explanation:

Given the content of example.fasta as:

>seq1
ATGCGTACGTTAGCAGT
>seq2
CGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGC

The program processes these sequences and outputs the following:

Length: 14, GC: 7
Length: 10, GC: 6
Successfully processed 2 sequences.

Output Breakdown:

    For seq1 (ATGCGTACGTTAGCAGT):
        Length: The sequence has 14 nucleotides.
        GC content: The GC count is 7 because there are 7 nucleotides that are either 'G' or 'C' in this sequence (G, C, G, C, G, G, C).

    For seq2 (CGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGC):
        Length: This sequence has 10 nucleotides.
        GC content: The GC count is 6 because there are 6 'G' or 'C' nucleotides in this sequence (C, G, C, G, C, G).

  ###  Final Summary:
        The program successfully processed 2 sequences from the FASTA file.

Key Concepts:

    Parallelism with Rayon:
        Rayon enables parallel processing by allowing par_iter() to divide the workload of processing sequences across multiple threads. This improves the efficiency of handling large FASTA files by processing them concurrently.

    FASTA File Parsing:
        The program parses a FASTA file, extracting the nucleotide sequences and ignoring any headers (lines starting with '>').

    GC Content Calculation:
        The GC content is computed by counting how many 'G' or 'C' nucleotides appear in each sequence. This is done using Rust's iterator methods like chars() and filter().

Use Case:

This kind of program is useful for bioinformatics tasks such as:

    Analyzing genomic data to compute the GC content of different sequences.
    Processing large numbers of sequences efficiently with parallel computation.
    Quickly summarizing genomic data from FASTA files.

### Notes:

    Error Handling: The program uses Rust’s Result type to handle any potential errors that may occur during file reading or processing.
    Scalability: Using Rayon’s parallel iterators makes the program capable of handling larger datasets efficiently by utilizing multiple CPU cores.

If you want to further customize the program or handle different kinds of biological data, feel free to ask for additional modifications!
